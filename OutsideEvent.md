#Outside Event

I attended a Game Makers' Guild Playtest. (The link to the meetup page can be found here:  http://www.meetup.com/Game-Makers-Guild/photos/26065558/#436580396)

Blind playtesting is conducted to test the rulebook more than the game.  The creator is in the room with the playtesters, but cannot explain how to play the game.  They must figure it out themselves based on the rules, then leave comments for the creator on how it can be improved.

We played a game called (I believe) Moonquake! wherein the player is an alien trying to collect cards that will help them reach an escape rocket at the top of the board and/or stall the other players.  We communicated with the creator during the game, pointing out pieces of information that we couldn't find or that were confusing.

After we finished playtesting, we filled out a "Blind Playtesting" sheet that included questions such as "Was the Rulebook laid out well, or were there any confusing aspects?" and "Were any rules of the game confusing and unnecessary?"  We then noted whether, based on a few similar categories, we thought it should receive the "Game Maker's Guild of Approval," or if it should go back for more editing.

All in all, it was a very fun, rewarding experience with great people and an informative look into what it takes to publish a game.  Very well recommended.
